# Fertilizer_Advisor
This is a browser-based tool to quickly recommend the primary fertilizer type (Nitrogen, Phosphorus, or Potassium) your soil needs.

How to Run
To run this application, simply save the code as fertilizer_advisor.html. Then, double-click the file to open it in any web browser. To use the tool, just click the N, P, or K button to receive a recommendation instantly.

N-P-K Explained
Fertilizers are rated by three numbers (N-P-K). N (Nitrogen) promotes green leaf and stem growth. P (Phosphorus) is essential for strong roots and flowering/fruiting. K (Potassium) improves overall plant health and disease resistance.

How It Works
The application uses simple JavaScript (inside the HTML file) to check which button you clicked and then displays the matching advice, including recommended fertilizer materials like Urea or Potash.
