Problem Statement: Farmers and new gardeners need quick help knowing which kind of fertilizer to buy when their simple dirt test shows they are missing a main food (N, P, or K). This stops them from wasting money or hurting their plants.

Scope of the Project: This is just a simple tool on one screen that runs in your internet browser. It only gives quick, single answers for N, P, or K problems. It can't remember your answers or read complicated lab results.

Target Users: This tool is for small-scale farmers, new farmers, or people gardening at home who have simple test results showing they are missing one of the main plant foods (N, P, or K).

Features: The app has three big buttons you can click (N, P, K). When you click a button, it immediately shows you what that food does for the plant (like root growth), the name of the best fertilizer to use (like Urea), and the high NPK numbers you should look for.
